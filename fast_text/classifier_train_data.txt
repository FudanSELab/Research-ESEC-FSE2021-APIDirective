For float and double samples, the translation is an identity, i.e. normalized component values are equal to the corresponding sample values.	__label__1
Even when there is such a correspondence, the number of bits in a sample is not necessarily the same as the number of bits in the corresponding color/alpha component.	__label__1
flavor1.equals(flavor2);  As mentioned, flavor1 and flavor2 are considered identical.	__label__1
This allows an array smaller than the native data size to be provided for a constrained input.	__label__1
The number of color samples in the pixel values must be same as the number of color components in the ColorSpace.	__label__1

Each class implementing this interface will specify whether or not it will allow an in-place filtering operation (i.e. source object equal to the destination object).	__label__1
The PathIterator interface provides the mechanism for objects that implement the Shape interface to return the geometry of their boundary by allowing a caller to retrieve the path of that boundary a segment at a time.	__label__1
The normalized component values of instances of this class have a range which depends on the transfer type as follows: for float samples, the full range of the float data type; for double samples, the full range of the float data type (resulting from casting double to float); for short samples, from approximately -maxVal to +maxVal, where maxVal is the per component maximum value for the ColorSpace (-32767 maps to -maxVal, 0 maps to 0.0, and 32767 maps to +maxVal).	__label__1
Classes that implement this interface must specify whether or not they allow in-place filtering-- filter operations where the source object is equal to the destination object.	__label__1
This means a Font deserialized from such a stream will not compare equal to the original Font that contained the non-serializable attributes.	__label__1
Thus, sample values range from 0 to 2n - 1.	__label__1
These values will often be 0.0 and 1.0 (e.g. normalized component values for the default sRGB color space range from 0.0 to 1.0), but some color spaces have component values with different upper and lower limits.	__label__1
For example, the MIME type of imageFlavor is "image/x-java-image;class=java.awt.Image", the primary type is image, the subtype is x-java-image, and the representation class is java.awt.Image.	__label__1
The data type may be TYPE_UNDEFINED or one of the types defined below.	__label__1
The range for an alpha component should be 0.0 to 1.0.	__label__1
[ 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 ] [ b1 ] [ 0.0 -1.0 0.0 255.0 ] x [ b2 ] [ 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 ] [ b3 ] [ 1 ]  Note that the source and destination can be the same object.	__label__1
It is the responsibility of applications to appropriately scale pixel data before rendering such that color components fall within the normalized range of the ColorSpace (obtained using the getMinValue and getMaxValue methods of the ColorSpace class) and the alpha component is between 0.0 and 1.0.	__label__1
In other words, the representation class is the type of object returned by Transferable#getTransferData.	__label__1

The listener interface for receiving notification of events dispatched to objects that are instances of Component or MenuComponent or their subclasses.	__label__1
Filters should subclass this class and override the methods which deal with the data that needs to be filtered and modify it as necessary.	__label__1
Stateful operations, such as distinct and sorted, may incorporate state from previously seen elements when processing new elements.	__label__1
Stateless operations, such as filter and map, retain no state from previously seen element when processing a new element -- each element can be processed independently of operations on other elements.	__label__1
"Laziness also allows avoiding examining all the data when it is not necessary; for operations such as ""find the first string longer than 1000 characters"", it is only necessary to examine just enough strings to find one that has the desired characteristics without examining all of the strings available from the source."	__label__1
After the terminal operation is performed, the stream pipeline is considered consumed, and can no longer be used; if you need to traverse the same data source again, you must return to the data source to get a new stream.	__label__1

The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.	__label__1
This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs.	__label__1
Returns Object[] an array containing all of the elements in this collection	__label__1
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection.	__label__0
If this collection makes any guarantees as to what order its elements are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements in the same order.	__label__1
"The returned array will be ""safe"" in that no references to it are maintained by this collection."	__label__1
(In other words, this method must allocate a new array even if this collection is backed by an array).	__label__1

For example, a Permissions object might have a FilePermissionCollection for all the FilePermission objects, a SocketPermissionCollection for all the SocketPermission objects, and so on.	__label__1
That is, its members are each a homogeneous PermissionCollection.	__label__1
For example, Permissions is a PermissionCollection subclass that represents a collection of PermissionCollections.	__label__1
A PermissionCollection may also be heterogeneous.	__label__1
For example, the Permissions object uses a default PermissionCollection implementation that stores the permission objects in a Hashtable.	__label__1
If newPermissionCollection returns null, the PermissionCollection is free to store the permission in any type of PermissionCollection it desires (one using a Hashtable, one using a Vector, etc.).	__label__1
Whenever a permission is added to a heterogeneous PermissionCollection such as Permissions, and the PermissionCollection doesn't yet contain a PermissionCollection of the specified permission's type, the PermissionCollection should call the newPermissionCollection method on the permission's class to see if it requires a special PermissionCollection.	__label__1
Its add method adds a permission to the appropriate collection.	__label__1
Furthermore, Enumerations returned via the elements method are not fail-fast.	__label__1

When the method acceptChanges executes successfully, in addition to writing changes to the data source, it makes the values in the current row be the values in the original row.	__label__0
Depending on the synchronization level of the SyncProvider implementation being used, the writer will compare the original values with those in the data source to check for conflicts.	__label__0
When there is a conflict, the RIOptimisticProvider implementation, for example, throws a SyncProviderException and does not write anything to the data source.	__label__1
An application may choose to catch the SyncProviderException object and retrieve the SyncResolver object it contains.	__label__1
Propagates row update, insert and delete changes made to this CachedRowSet object to the underlying data source.	__label__0
Standard CachedRowSet implementations should use the SyncFactory singleton to obtain a SyncProvider instance providing a RowSetWriter object (writer).	__label__1
The writer will attempt to propagate changes made in this CachedRowSet object back to the data source.	__label__0
The SyncResolver object lists the conflicts row by row and sets a lock on the data source to avoid further conflicts while the current conflicts are being resolved.	__label__0
Further, for each conflict, it provides methods for examining the conflict and setting the value that should be persisted in the data source.	__label__0
This allows for wrapping exceptions from distributed communications (RMI, EJB, etc.)	__label__1
MBeanException and RuntimeOperationsException must be thrown on every public method.	__label__1

For example, you can query a TextField t for its action listeners with the following code: ActionListener[] als = (ActionListener[])(t.getListeners(ActionListener.class)); .	__label__1
You can specify the listenerType argument with a class literal, such as FooListener.class.	__label__1
FooListeners are registered using the addFooListener method.	__label__1
Returns an array of all the objects currently registered as FooListeners upon this TextField.	__label__0

Returns the primary 1 color.	__label__1
This returns a color with rgb values of 102, 102, and 153, respectively.	__label__0
When constructing a Color with an explicit alpha or getting the color/alpha components of a Color, the color components are never premultiplied by the alpha component.	__label__1
For further information on sRGB, see http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Graphics/Color/sRGB.html .	__label__0
The Color class is used to encapsulate colors in the default sRGB color space or colors in arbitrary color spaces identified by a ColorSpace.	__label__0
An alpha value of 1.0 or 255 means that the color is completely opaque and an alpha value of 0 or 0.0 means that the color is completely transparent.	__label__0
An AttributeValueExp may be used anywhere a ValueExp is required.	__label__1
If necessary paints the background of the component, then invokes paint.	__label__1

Refer to AWT Threading Issues for details on AWT's threading model.	__label__0
Removes the specified action listener.	__label__0
Calling this method with null or an invalid value has no effect.	__label__1
This method differs from the setBinaryStream (int, InputStream) method because it informs the driver that the parameter value should be sent to the server as a BLOB.	__label__1
Sets the designated parameter to a InputStream object.	__label__0
When the setBinaryStream method is used, the driver may have to do extra work to determine whether the parameter data should be send to the server as a LONGVARBINARY or a BLOB Note: Consult your JDBC driver documentation to determine if it might be more efficient to use a version of setBlob which takes a length parameter.	__label__1

The unit must either have an exact duration or be ChronoUnit.DAYS which is treated as 24 hours.	__label__1
Only a subset of units are accepted by this method.	__label__1
The conversion loops around the set of units from the amount and uses the duration of the unit to calculate the total Duration.	__label__1
A TemporalAmount represents an amount of time, which may be date-based or time-based, which this factory extracts to a duration.	__label__0
This obtains a duration based on the specified amount.	__label__0

In order to call this method, a RowSet object must have implemented the RowSetInternal interface and registered this RowSetReader object as its reader.	__label__1
Reads the new contents of the calling RowSet object.	__label__0
The readData method adds rows to the caller.	__label__0
The readData method is invoked internally by the RowSet.execute method for rowsets that support the reader/writer paradigm.	__label__1
In general, a reader may invoke any of the rowset's methods, with one exception.	__label__0
It can be implemented in a wide variety of ways and can even populate the caller with rows from a nonrelational data source.	__label__0
Also, when a reader invokes RowSet methods, no listeners are notified; that is, no RowSetEvent objects are generated and no RowSetListener methods are invoked.	__label__1
Calling the method execute will cause an SQLException to be thrown because execute may not be called recursively.	__label__0
Note that if the event parameter is null the behavior is unspecified and may result in an exception.	__label__1
Returns the window title background color of the current theme.	__label__0
Processes action events occurring on this text field by dispatching them to any registered ActionListener objects.	__label__0

This method should be used only when auto-commit mode has been disabled.	__label__1
It may also contain a string describing the exception.	__label__0
It contains a minor code, which gives more detailed information about what caused the exception, and a completion status.	__label__0
For example, this exception could be raised if an error occurred when trying to register a resource.	__label__1
Unless otherwise specified, methods in this package will throw a NullPointerException if given a null argument.	__label__1
Identifies the Latin-1 (European) and extended range, and Latin-1 (European) decimal base.	__label__0
This implementation visits a UnionType by calling defaultAction.	__label__0
(This is useful in determining the length of this collection only if the caller knows that this collection does not contain any null elements.)	__label__1
If this collection makes any guarantees as to what order its elements are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements in the same order.	__label__1
Like the toArray() method, this method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs.	__label__1
Further, this method allows precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may, under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.	__label__1
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection; the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.	__label__0
If the collection fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.	__label__1
Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and the size of this collection.	__label__1
If this collection fits in the specified array with room to spare (i.e., the array has more elements than this collection), the element in the array immediately following the end of the collection is set to null.	__label__1
Constructs an ActivateFailedException with the specified detail message.	__label__0
A Context object may be named for purposes of specifying a starting search scope.	__label__0
Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting on the given condition associated with this synchronizer.	__label__0
The following code can be used to dump the collection into a newly allocated array of String: String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]); .	__label__1
The returned string may be empty but may not be null.	__label__1
A type-safe enumeration of possible orientations.	__label__0
Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to a constructor or method in any class or interface in this package will cause a NullPointerException to be thrown.	__label__1
Provides classes for networking applications.	__label__0
These classes include factories for creating sockets.	__label__0
In the default sRGB space.	__label__0
The SQL query returned by this method is used by RowSet methods such as execute and populate, which may be implemented by any class that extends the BaseRowSet abstract class and implements one or more of the standard JSR-114 RowSet interfaces.	__label__1
Flips to the previous card of the specified container.	__label__0
If selfChange is true, only delivers the notification to the observer if it has indicated that it wants to receive self-change notifications by implementing deliverSelfNotifications() to return true.	__label__1
Computes the hash code for this Color.	__label__0
Index to location.	__label__0
When the POA has the NON_RETAIN policy it uses servant managers that are ServantLocators.	__label__0
When the POA uses the ServantLocator interface, immediately after performing the operation invocation on the servant returned by preinvoke, the POA will invoke postinvoke on the servant manager, passing the ObjectId value and the Servant value as parameters (among others).	__label__1
Updates the expanded state of all the descendants of path by getting the expanded descendants from the tree and forwarding to the tree state.	__label__0
This method should be used when RowSet does not already have a match column set.	__label__1
If compArray is null, an array with length equal to the number of components in cspace is created for the return value.	__label__1
Otherwise, compArray must have at least this length, and it is filled in with the components and returned.	__label__1
This might be confusing for the code calling createMBean() or registerMBean(), as such code might assume that MBean registration has failed when such an exception is raised.	__label__1
However, throwing an exception in postRegister will not change the state of the MBean: if the MBean was already registered (registrationDone is true), the MBean will remain registered.	__label__1
If the implementation of this method throws a RuntimeException or an Error, the MBean Server will rethrow those inside a RuntimeMBeanException or RuntimeErrorException, respectively.	__label__1

Types include primitive types, declared types (class and interface types), array types, type variables, and the null type.	__label__0
Represents a type in the Java programming language.	__label__0
Using instanceof is not necessarily a reliable idiom for determining the effective class of an object in this modeling hierarchy since an implementation may choose to have a single object implement multiple TypeMirror subinterfaces.	__label__1
To implement operations based on the class of an TypeMirror object, either use a visitor or use the result of the getKind() method.	__label__1
There is no guarantee that any particular type will always be represented by the same object.	__label__1
Thus, the specified values are returned directly even if they are null.	__label__1

It may also contain a string describing the exception.	__label__0
See the section meaning of minor codes to see the minor codes for this exception.	__label__0
This exception is raised if communication is lost while an operation is in progress, after the request was sent by the client, but before the reply from the server has been returned to the client.	__label__1
It contains a minor code, which gives more detailed information about what caused the exception, and a completion status.	__label__0
Returns the supported cursor dimension which is closest to the desired sizes.	__label__0
Default JComponent constructor.	__label__0
Systems which don't support custom cursors will return a dimension of 0, 0.	__label__1
Note: if an image is used whose dimensions don't match a supported size (as returned by this method), the Toolkit implementation will attempt to resize the image to a supported size.	__label__1
Since converting low-resolution images is difficult, no guarantees are made as to the quality of a cursor image which isn't a supported size.	__label__1
It is therefore recommended that this method be called and an appropriate image used so no image conversion is made.	__label__1
This constructor does very little initialization beyond calling the Container constructor.	__label__1
This method throws an IllegalArgumentException if source is null.	__label__1
Constructs a MouseWheelEvent object with the specified source component, type, modifiers, coordinates, scroll type, scroll amount, and wheel rotation.	__label__0

The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this RowSet object's command when the method execute is called.	__label__1
The driver converts this to an SQL ARRAY value when it sends it to the database.	__label__1
Sets the designated parameter to an Array object in the Java programming language.	__label__0
Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero, the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number parameterIndex is element number parameterIndex -1.	__label__1
After this method has been called, a call to the method getParams will return an object array of the current command parameters, which will include the Array object set for placeholder parameter number parameterIndex.	__label__1
Methods such as execute and populate must be provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or more of the standard JSR-114 RowSet interfaces.	__label__1
Note that methods to accommodate new language constructs could be added in a source compatible way if they were added as default methods.	__label__1

"The TransformerHandler interface allows a transformation to be created from SAX2 parse events, which is a ""push"" model rather than the ""pull"" model that normally occurs for a transformation."	__label__1
Normal parse events are received through the ContentHandler interface, lexical events such as startCDATA and endCDATA are received through the LexicalHandler interface, and events that signal the start or end of disabling output escaping are received via ContentHandler.processingInstruction(java.lang.String, java.lang.String), with the target parameter being Result.PI_DISABLE_OUTPUT_ESCAPING and Result.PI_ENABLE_OUTPUT_ESCAPING.	__label__1
Returns a float array containing only the color components of the Color, in the ColorSpace of the Color.	__label__0

The second is to use with(TemporalField, long): // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended temporal = thisField.adjustInto(temporal); temporal = temporal.with(thisField); .	__label__1
It is recommended to use the second approach, with(TemporalField), as it is a lot clearer to read in code.	__label__1
Implementations should perform any queries or calculations using the fields available in ChronoField.	__label__1
If the field is not supported an UnsupportedTemporalTypeException must be thrown.	__label__1

Returns the pixel bounds of the glyph at index when this GlyphVector is rendered in a Graphics with the given FontRenderContext at the given location.	__label__0
The usage is subject to the following constraints: If the collection item type (for collection property) or property type (for single valued property) is JAXBElement, then @XmlElementRef}.name() and @XmlElementRef.namespace() must point an element factory method with an @XmlElementDecl annotation in a class annotated with @XmlRegistry (usually ObjectFactory class generated by the schema compiler) : @XmlElementDecl.name() must equal @XmlElementRef.name() @XmlElementDecl.namespace() must equal @XmlElementRef.namespace().	__label__1
The presence of @XmlElementRef annotation on an element property indicates that the element name from JAXBElement instance be used instead of deriving an XML element name from the JavaBean property name.	__label__1

If listener l is null, no exception is thrown and no action is performed.	__label__1
Visits a type parameter element.	__label__0
Classes implementing this interface are used to operate on a value when the type of that value is unknown at compile time.	__label__1
When a visitor is passed to a value's accept method, the visitXYZ method applicable to that value is invoked.	__label__1
A visitor of the values of annotation type elements, using a variant of the visitor design pattern.	__label__0
Unlike a standard visitor which dispatches based on the concrete type of a member of a type hierarchy, this visitor dispatches based on the type of data stored; there are no distinct subclasses for storing, for example, boolean values versus int values.	__label__1
Therefore, visitor classes directly implementing this interface may be source incompatible with future versions of the platform.	__label__1
Classes implementing this interface may or may not throw a NullPointerException if the additional parameter p is null; see documentation of the implementing class for details.	__label__1
WARNING: It is possible that methods will be added to this interface to accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures added to future versions of the Java™ programming language.	__label__1

"Constant for the ""+"" key."	__label__0
This permission should be used only during testing, or in extremely rare cases where an application or applet is completely trusted and adding the necessary permissions to the policy is prohibitively cumbersome.	__label__1
The AllPermission is a permission that implies all other permissions.	__label__0
Note: Granting AllPermission should be done with extreme care, as it implies all other permissions.	__label__1
Thus, it grants code the ability to run with security disabled.	__label__1
Extreme caution should be taken before granting such a permission to code.	__label__1
Gets the current value at position i.	__label__0
This package implements DOM-specific transformation APIs.	__label__0
If a node is specified, it should be one of the following: Document, Element, or DocumentFragment.	__label__1
The DOMLocator node may be passed to TransformerException objects, and retrieved by trying to cast the result of the TransformerException.getLocator() method.	__label__1
If the result is a Document, the output of the transformation must have a single element root to set as the document element.	__label__1
Constant for the Hiragana function key.	__label__0
A URL Connection to a Java ARchive (JAR) file or an entry in a JAR file.	__label__0
The example above is a JAR URL which refers to a JAR entry.	__label__0
for example: jar:http://www.foo.com/bar/baz.jar!/COM/foo/Quux.class Jar URLs should be used to refer to a JAR file or entries in a JAR file.	__label__1
"For example: URL url = new URL(""jar:file:/home/duke/duke.jar!/""); JarURLConnection jarConnection = (JarURLConnection)url.openConnection(); Manifest manifest = jarConnection.getManifest(); ."	__label__0
If the entry name is omitted, the URL refers to the whole JAR file: jar:http://www.foo.com/bar/baz.jar!/ Users should cast the generic URLConnection to a JarURLConnection when they know that the URL they created is a JAR URL, and they need JAR-specific functionality.	__label__1
It is not possible to get a OutputStream to modify or write to the underlying JAR file using this class.	__label__1
JarURLConnection instances can only be used to read from JAR files.	__label__1
When constructing a JAR url via new URL(context, spec), the following rules apply: if there is no context URL and the specification passed to the URL constructor doesn't contain a separator, the URL is considered to refer to a JarFile.	__label__1
Returns E the head of this deque, or null if this deque is empty	__label__1

Returns a hashcode for this ImageGraphicAttribute.	__label__1
A mixin interface for an element that has a qualified name.	__label__0
Note: Because no markup is recognized within a CDATASection, character numeric references cannot be used as an escape mechanism when serializing.	__label__1
Therefore, action needs to be taken when serializing a CDATASection with a character encoding where some of the contained characters cannot be represented.	__label__1
Sets the designated parameter to the given java.lang.BigDecimal value.	__label__0
Note, however, that some code conversion libraries at the time of writing do not return an error or exception when a character is missing from the encoding, making the task of ensuring that data is not corrupted on serialization more difficult.	__label__1
Therefore, the values returned by this method are guaranteed to be meaningful only for KEY_TYPED events.	__label__1

If this Class object represents a type whose declaration does not explicitly indicate an annotated superclass, then the return value is an AnnotatedType object representing an element with no annotations.	__label__1
Reads a WebRowSet object in its XML format from the given Reader object.	__label__0
Notifies all of the listeners registered with this RowSet object that its entire contents have changed.	__label__0

Deprecated.	__label__1
Constructs a new TextArea.	__label__0
A default model is set, the initial string is null, and rows/columns are set to 0.	__label__1
Therefore, methods must be invoked only on the kind of type codes to which they apply.	__label__1
If myIntHolder is an instance of IntHolder, the value stored in its value field can be accessed with myIntHolder.value.	__label__1

The management interface for a memory pool.	__label__0
This method should never be called by an application, but is called from with a RowSet implementation extending this class.	__label__1
This method returns an array of length 0 if the class declares no classes or interfaces as members, or if this Class object represents a primitive type, an array class, or void.	__label__1
The details as to how this is initiated are implementation specific but typically the application has already started and its main method has already been invoked.	__label__0
Invoked when the user attempts an invalid operation, such as pasting into an uneditable JTextField that has focus.	__label__1

Local interfaces are implemented by using CORBA::LocalObject to provide implementations of Object pseudo operations and any other ORB-specific support mechanisms that are appropriate for such objects.	__label__1
Object implementation techniques are inherently language-mapping specific.	__label__0
Therefore, the LocalObject type is not defined in IDL, but is specified in each language mapping.	__label__1
"Methods that do not apply to local objects throw an org.omg.CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT exception with the message, ""This is a locally contrained object."""	__label__1

Returns the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed double value between 0.0 and 1.0 from this random number generator's sequence.	__label__0
When such a new visit method is added, the default implementation in this class will be to call the visitUnknown method.	__label__1
[In early versions of Java, the result was incorrectly calculated as: return (((long)next(27) << 27) + next(27)) / (double)(1L << 54); This might seem to be equivalent, if not better, but in fact it introduced a large nonuniformity because of the bias in the rounding of floating-point numbers: it was three times as likely that the low-order bit of the significand would be 0 than that it would be 1!	__label__1
Permission controlling access to MBeanServer operations.	__label__0
Description copied from class: Number	__label__0
Returns an array containing one or more column numbers indicating the columns that form a key that uniquely identifies a row in this CachedRowSet object.	__label__0

The driver converts this to an SQL SMALLINT value when it sends it to the database.	__label__1
Sets this RowSet object's command property to the given String object and clears the parameters, if any, that were set for the previous command.	__label__0
Subclasses of this exception may be thrown by visitors to indicate that the visitor was created for a prior version of the language.	__label__1
The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this RowSet object's command when the method execute is called.	__label__1
Superclass of exceptions which indicate that an unknown kind of entity was encountered.	__label__0
This situation can occur if the language evolves and new kinds of constructs are introduced.	__label__1
The specified class loader is used to load the class or interface.	__label__0
If the parameter loader is null, the class is loaded through the bootstrap class loader.	__label__1
Returns the Class object associated with the class or interface with the given string name, using the given class loader.	__label__0
Therefore, this method cannot be used to obtain any of the Class objects representing primitive types or void.	__label__1
The class is initialized only if the initialize parameter is true and if it has not been initialized earlier.	__label__1
This data is stored persistently in an implementation-dependent backing store.	__label__0

WARNING: The AnnotationValueVisitor interface implemented by this class may have methods added to it in the future to accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures added to future versions of the Java™ programming language.	__label__1
If name is null or pcl is null, no exception is thrown and no action is performed.	__label__1
Note that adding a default implementation of a new visit method in a visitor class will occur instead of adding a default method directly in the visitor interface since a Java SE 8 language feature cannot be used to this version of the API since this version is required to be runnable on Java SE 7 implementations.	__label__1
When the new visitor is introduced, all or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.	__label__1
MBeanException and RuntimeOperationsException must be thrown on every public method.	__label__1
This allows for wrapping exceptions from distributed communications (RMI, EJB, etc.).	__label__1
These exceptions do not have to be thrown by the implementation except in the scenarios described in the specification and javadoc.	__label__1

A property value may be either a printable string or a binary string of colon-separated pairs of hexadecimal digits.	__label__1
where domainName and keystoreName are identifiers and property is a key/value pairing.	__label__1
If no prototype display value has been specified, the renderer must be configured for each value from the model and its preferred size obtained, which can be relatively expensive.	__label__1
Specifying the preferred display value is often useful when the combo box will be displaying large amounts of data.	__label__1
If a prototype display value is specified, the preferred size of the combo box is calculated by configuring the renderer with the prototype display value and obtaining its preferred size.	__label__1
Sets the prototype display value used to calculate the size of the display for the UI portion.	__label__0
"In other cases in which multiple threads are expected to access a common collection, ""concurrent"" versions are normally preferable."	__label__1
And unsynchronized collections are preferable when either collections are unshared, or are accessible only when holding other locks.	__label__1
Creates a concrete, platform dependent, subclass of the abstract DragGestureRecognizer class requested, and associates it with the DragSource, Component and DragGestureListener specified.	__label__0
subclasses should override this to provide their own implementation	__label__1
"The ""Concurrent"" prefix used with some classes in this package is a shorthand indicating several differences from similar ""synchronized"" classes."	__label__0
For example java.util.Hashtable and Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap()) are synchronized.	__label__0
In the particular case of ConcurrentHashMap, it safely permits any number of concurrent reads as well as a tunable number of concurrent writes.	__label__0
"""Synchronized"" classes can be useful when you need to prevent all access to a collection via a single lock, at the expense of poorer scalability."	__label__0
"But ConcurrentHashMap is ""concurrent""."	__label__0
Creates a new card layout with the specified horizontal and vertical gaps.	__label__0
This class is provided for cases where it is not possible to create a writable temporary file.	__label__1

Move the cursor by a relative amount, forward or backward, from the current position.	__label__0
Positive offsets move forwards, negative offsets move backwards.	__label__0
If the final position is outside of the bounds of the result set then the resultant position will be pinned to -1 or count() depending on whether the value is off the front or end of the set, respectively.	__label__1
This method will return true if the requested destination was reachable, otherwise, it returns false.	__label__1
For example, if the cursor is at currently on the second entry in the result set and move(-5) is called, the position will be pinned at -1, and false will be returned.	__label__1
Parameters offset int: the offset to be applied from the current position.	__label__0
Returns boolean whether the requested move fully succeeded.	__label__0
The Descriptor fields contributed in this way by different annotations on the same program element must be consistent.	__label__1
That is, two different annotations, or two members of the same annotation, must not define a different value for the same Descriptor field.	__label__1
Implementations may use a caching strategy for performance reasons.	__label__1
"Similarly, if the annotation looks like this: @Documented @Target(ElementType.METHOD) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) public @interface Units { @DescriptorKey(""units"") String value(); @DescriptorKey(""descriptionResourceKey"") String resourceKey() default """"; @DescriptorKey(""descriptionResourceBundleBaseName"") String resourceBundleBaseName() default """"; } and it is used like this: public interface CacheControlMBean { @Units(""bytes"", resourceKey=""bytes.key"", resourceBundleBaseName=""com.example.foo.MBeanResources"") public long getCacheSize(); } then the resulting Descriptor will contain the following fields: NameValue units""bytes"" descriptionResourceKey""bytes.key"" descriptionResourceBundleBaseName ""com.example.foo.MBeanResources"" An annotation such as @Units can be applied to: a Standard MBean or MXBean interface; a method in such an interface; a parameter of a method in a Standard MBean or MXBean interface when that method is an operation (not a getter or setter for an attribute); a public constructor in the class that implements a Standard MBean or MXBean; a parameter in such a constructor."	__label__1

Package Specification Input Method Framework Specification Input Method Client API Reference Related Documentation For overviews, tutorials, examples, guides, and tool documentation, please see: Input Method Framework Overview Input Method Client API Tutorial	__label__0
However, the framework also supports input methods for other languages and the use of entirely different input mechanisms, such as handwriting or speech recognition.	__label__0
They are commonly used to enter Japanese, Chinese, or Korean - languages using thousands of different characters - on keyboards with far fewer keys.	__label__0
This package enables text editing components to receive text input through input methods.	__label__0
Provides classes and interfaces for the input method framework.	__label__0
Sets the command string used for action events.	__label__0
When the POA has the RETAIN policy it uses servant managers that are ServantActivators.	__label__0
Serialization notes: The LogRecord class is serializable.	__label__0
Because objects in the parameters array may not be serializable, during serialization all objects in the parameters array are written as the corresponding Strings (using Object.toString).	__label__0
Note that if the client application has not specified an explicit source method name and source class name, then the LogRecord class will infer them automatically when they are first accessed (due to a call on getSourceMethodName or getSourceClassName) by analyzing the call stack.	__label__0
Therefore, if a logging Handler wants to pass off a LogRecord to another thread, or to transmit it over RMI, and if it wishes to subsequently obtain method name or class name information it should call one of getSourceClassName or getSourceMethodName to force the values to be filled in.	__label__1
LogRecord objects are used to pass logging requests between the logging framework and individual log Handlers.	__label__0
When a LogRecord is passed into the logging framework it logically belongs to the framework and should no longer be used or updated by the client application.	__label__0
The method annotated with PostConstruct MUST be invoked even if the class does not request any resources to be injected.	__label__1
This annotation MUST be supported on all classes that support dependency injection.	__label__1
This method MUST be invoked before the class is put into service.	__label__1
The PostConstruct annotation is used on a method that needs to be executed after dependency injection is done to perform any initialization.	__label__0
- The method MUST NOT throw a checked exception.	__label__1
- The return type of the method MUST be void.	__label__1
The method on which the PostConstruct annotation is applied MUST fulfill all of the following criteria - - The method MUST NOT have any parameters except in the case of EJB interceptors in which case it takes an InvocationC ontext object as defined by the EJB specification.	__label__1
Only one method can be annotated with this annotation.	__label__1
Depending on the Toolkit implementation, different EventQueues may be returned for different applets.	__label__1
Interface implemented by an MBean that emits Notifications.	__label__0
- The method MUST NOT be static except for the application client.	__label__1
- The method on which PostConstruct is applied MAY be public, protected, package private or private.	__label__1
Calls made to the method getParams after setAsciiStream has been called will return an array containing the parameter values that have been set.	__label__1
The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array returned by the method getParams, with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.	__label__1
Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero, the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number parameterIndex is element number parameterIndex -1.	__label__1
In other words, if the input stream being set is the value for the second placeholder parameter, the array containing it will be the second element in the array returned by getParams.	__label__1
Returns all the field values in the descriptor as an array of Objects.	__label__0
Converts the digits in the text that occur between start and start + count, using the provided context.	__label__0
This method throws the exception BAD_OPERATION under two conditions: the type of the element contained in the Any object is not X the method extract_X is called before the value field of the Any object has been set There are distinct method pairs for each primitive IDL data type (insert_long and extract_long, insert_string and extract_string, and so on).	__label__1
This should very rarely pose a problem since these attributes are typically used only in special circumstances and are unlikely to be serialized.	__label__1
The color gray.	__label__0
In the default sRGB space.	__label__0
Exceptions thrown by JMX implementations.	__label__0
Note that the method insert_X also resets the Any object's type field if necessary.	__label__1
The interface for an annotation processor.	__label__0
Indicates that a field defining a constant value may be referenced from native code.	__label__0
The annotation may be used as a hint by tools that generate native header files to determine whether a header file is required, and if so, what declarations it should contain.	__label__1
The interface to a Diffie-Hellman private key.	__label__0
The length of the duration is stored using two fields - seconds and nanoseconds.	__label__1
Constructs a KeyEvent object.	__label__0
The total duration is defined by calling this method and getSeconds().	__label__1
The nanoseconds part is a value from 0 to 999,999,999 that is an adjustment to the length in seconds.	__label__1
A negative duration is expressed by the negative sign of the seconds part.	__label__1
A Duration represents a directed distance between two points on the time-line.	__label__0
A duration of -1 nanosecond is stored as -1 seconds plus 999,999,999 nanoseconds.	__label__1
Accordingly, behavioral parameters in stream pipelines whose source might not be concurrent should never modify the stream's data source.	__label__1
Such parameters are always instances of a functional interface such as Function, and are often lambda expressions or method references.	__label__1
A behavioral parameter is said to interfere with a non-concurrent data source if it modifies, or causes to be modified, the stream's data source.	__label__1

An encoder should always be used by making the following sequence of method invocations, hereinafter referred to as an encoding operation: Reset the encoder via the reset method, unless it has not been used before; Invoke the encode method zero or more times, as long as additional input may be available, passing false for the endOfInput argument and filling the input buffer and flushing the output buffer between invocations; Invoke the encode method one final time, passing true for the endOfInput argument; and then Invoke the flush method so that the encoder can flush any internal state to the output buffer.	__label__1
Request Information, accessible to client-side request interceptors.	__label__0
The FileDialog class displays a dialog window from which the user can select a file.	__label__0
(If none of the installed providers supply an implementation of SecureRandom, a system-provided source of randomness is used.)	__label__1
Since it is a modal dialog, when the application calls its show method to display the dialog, it blocks the rest of the application until the user has chosen a file.	__label__0
There is also one that takes just a keysize argument, and uses the SecureRandom implementation of the highest-priority installed provider as the source of randomness.	__label__1
The class loader to be used is identified by its object name.	__label__1

an opportunity to lazily evaluate desktop property values.	__label__0
The equals method implements an equivalence relation on non-null object references: It is reflexive: for any non-null reference value x, x.equals(x) should return true.	__label__1
"Indicates whether some other object is ""equal to"" this one."	__label__0
It is transitive: for any non-null reference values x, y, and z, if x.equals(y) returns true and y.equals(z) returns true, then x.equals(z) should return true.	__label__1
It is symmetric: for any non-null reference values x and y, x.equals(y) should return true if and only if y.equals(x) returns true.	__label__1
For any non-null reference value x, x.equals(null) should return false.	__label__1
It is consistent: for any non-null reference values x and y, multiple invocations of x.equals(y) consistently return true or consistently return false, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the objects is modified.	__label__1
Note that it is generally necessary to override the hashCode method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the general contract for the hashCode method, which states that equal objects must have equal hash codes.	__label__1
The equals method for class Object implements the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects; that is, for any non-null reference values x and y, this method returns true if and only if x and y refer to the same object (x == y has the value true).	__label__1
Returns boolean true if this object is the same as the obj argument; false otherwise.	__label__1
Parameters o Object: the reference object with which to compare.	__label__1
Bound property name for showsRootHandles.	__label__0

"If a security manager is present, and the caller's class loader is not null and the caller's class loader is not the same as or an ancestor of the class loader for the class whose class loader is requested, then this method calls the security manager's checkPermission method with a RuntimePermission(""getClassLoader"") permission to ensure it's ok to access the class loader for the class."	__label__1
This method will return null in such implementations if this class was loaded by the bootstrap class loader.	__label__1
An implementation can favor responding to an interrupt over normal method return in response to a signal, or over indicating the elapse of the specified waiting time.	__label__1
Typically, an exception will be thrown (such as IllegalMonitorStateException) and the implementation must document that fact.	__label__1
Implementation Considerations The current thread is assumed to hold the lock associated with this Condition when this method is called.	__label__1
In either case the implementation must ensure that the signal is redirected to another waiting thread, if there is one.	__label__1
True if the root node is displayed, false if its children are the highest visible nodes.	__label__0
severityNumber 0-6 where 0: unknown; 1: non-recoverable; 2: critical, failure; 3: major, severe; 4: minor, marginal, error; 5: warning; 6: normal, cleared, informative messageIDString Unique key for message text (to allow translation, analysis).	__label__1

Sets the designated parameter to a Reader object.	__label__0
Stream based logging Handler.	__label__0
IIOByteBuffer is used by ImageInputStream to supply a sequence of bytes to the caller, possibly with fewer copies than using the conventional read methods that take a user-supplied byte array.	__label__0
Facilities for declaring annotation processors and for allowing annotation processors to communicate with an annotation processing tool environment.	__label__0
The byte array referenced by an IIOByteBuffer will generally be part of an internal data structure belonging to an ImageReader implementation; its contents should be considered read-only and must not be modified.	__label__1
Returns the tooltip string associated with this TrayIcon.	__label__0
Note that if the event parameter is null the behavior is unspecified and may result in an exception.	__label__1
This exception indicates that a violation of a dynamically checked type constraint was detected.	__label__0
This exception can be thrown by the generated setter methods of the schema derived Java content classes.	__label__1
However, since fail-fast validation is an optional feature for JAXB Providers to support, not all setter methods will throw this exception when a type constraint is violated.	__label__1
If this exception is throw while invoking a fail-fast setter, the value of the property is guaranteed to remain unchanged, as if the setter were never called.	__label__1
In addition, the returned ResultSet object should have the following properties: ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE	__label__1
Returns a ResultSet object containing the original value for the current row only of this CachedRowSet object.	__label__0
The cursor for the ResultSet object should be positioned before the first row.	__label__1

Returns the editor used to paint and edit the selected item in the JComboBox field.	__label__0
Returns the control disabled color of the current theme.	__label__0
Used in XmlSchemaType.type() to signal that the type be inferred from the signature of the property.	__label__0
Instead, Font.getFont(Map) should be used to handle the FONT attribute.	__label__1
A flag used with getLayoutFlags that indicates that this GlyphVector has a complex glyph-to-char mapping (one that does not map glyphs to chars one-to-one in strictly ascending or descending order matching the run direction).	__label__0
"Constant for the ""Tagbanwa"" Unicode character block."	__label__0
To change the returned value it is necessary to set the sun.awt.enableExtraMouseButtons property before the Toolkit class initialization.	__label__1
Reports whether events from extra mouse buttons are allowed to be processed and posted into EventQueue.	__label__0
"Alternatively, the property could be set in the application by using the following code: System.setProperty(""sun.awt.enableExtraMouseButtons"", ""true""); ."	__label__1
This setting could be done on the application startup by the following command: java -Dsun.awt.enableExtraMouseButtons=false Application .	__label__1
If not set by the time of the Toolkit class initialization, this property will be initialized with true.	__label__1
before the Toolkit class initialization.	__label__1
Changing this value after the Toolkit class initialization will have no effect.	__label__1
RowSet objects that implement the Joinable interface must ensure that a key-like constraint continues to be enforced until the method CachedRowSet.unsetKeyColumns has been called on the designated column.	__label__1
Unsets the designated column as the match column for this RowSet object.	__label__0

This makes it possible to decouple configuration from KeyStore object creation and e.g.	__label__1
delay a password prompt until it is needed.	__label__1
Sets whether this window should always be above other windows.	__label__0
When an always-on-top window is sent toBack, its always-on-top state is set to false.	__label__1
"When this method is called on a window with a value of true, and the window is visible and the platform supports always-on-top for this window, the window is immediately brought forward, ""sticking"" it in the top-most position."	__label__1
When the window is later shown, it will be always-on-top.	__label__1
Parameters oldPosition int: the position that we're moving from newPosition int: the position that we're moving to Returns boolean true if the move is successful, false otherwise	__label__1
If it returns false the move function will also do so and the cursor will scroll to the beforeFirst position.	__label__1
This function is called every time the cursor is successfully scrolled to a new position, giving the subclass a chance to update any state it may have.	__label__0
This exception is raised whenever meaningful communication is not possible between client and server native code sets.	__label__1
It can also be used with the following annotations at the package level: XmlJavaTypeAdapter.	__label__1

If the bean's state can be expressed using only the no-argument constructor and public getter and setter methods for properties, no special knowledge is required.	__label__1
If you need (or choose) to provide a persistence delegate for a bean, you can do so either by using a DefaultPersistenceDelegate instance or by creating your own subclass of PersistenceDelegate.	__label__1
All classes provided in the JDK that descend from java.awt.Component, as well as all their properties, automatically have persistence delegates.	__label__0
Otherwise, you need to implement your own persistence delegate, for which you're likely to need the following classes: PersistenceDelegate The abstract class from which all persistence delegates descend.	__label__1
If the only reason a bean needs a persistence delegate is because you want to invoke the bean's constructor with property values as arguments, you can create the bean's persistence delegate with the one-argument DefaultPersistenceDelegate constructor.	__label__1
Your subclass should use its knowledge of the bean's type to provide whatever Statements and Expressions are necessary to create the bean and restore its state.	__label__1
Expression A subclass of Statement used for methods that return a value.	__label__1

For example, the Sun provider uses a default modulus size (keysize) of 1024 bits.	__label__1
In case the client does not explicitly initialize the KeyPairGenerator (via a call to an initialize method), each provider must supply (and document) a default initialization.	__label__1
(If none of the installed providers supply an implementation of SecureRandom, a system-provided source of randomness is used.)	__label__1
One also has a SecureRandom argument, while the the other uses the SecureRandom implementation of the highest-priority installed provider as the source of randomness.	__label__1
Algorithm-Specific Initialization For situations where a set of algorithm-specific parameters already exists (e.g., so-called community parameters in DSA), there are two initialize methods that have an AlgorithmParameterSpec argument.	__label__1
Still others might not have a list of precomputed parameters at all and instead always create new parameter sets.	__label__1
Other providers might have precomputed parameter sets for more than just the three modulus sizes mentioned above.	__label__1
If the modulus size is not one of the above values, the Sun provider creates a new set of parameters.	__label__1
If the algorithm is the DSA algorithm, and the keysize (modulus size) is 512, 768, or 1024, then the Sun provider uses a set of precomputed values for the p, q, and g parameters.	__label__1
Since no other parameters are specified when you call the above algorithm-independent initialize methods, it is up to the provider what to do about the algorithm-specific parameters (if any) to be associated with each of the keys.	__label__1

When an object is registered in the MBean Server using the registerMBean or createMBean methods of the MBeanServer interface, the object's class is examined to determine what type of MBean it is: If the class implements the interface DynamicMBean then the MBean is a Dynamic MBean.	__label__1
This is the recommended way to interact with managed objects when you know the model beforehand, regardless of whether you are using Standard MBeans or MXBeans: Standard MBeanMXBean MemoryPoolMBean proxy = JMX.newMBeanProxy( mbeanServer, objectName, MemoryPoolMBean.class); String name = proxy.getName(); MemoryUsage usage = proxy.getUsage(); long used = usage.getUsed(); MemoryPoolMXBean proxy = JMX.newMXBeanProxy( mbeanServer, objectName, MemoryPoolMXBean.class); String name = proxy.getName(); MemoryUsage usage = proxy.getUsage(); long used = usage.getUsed(); Implementing the MemoryPool object works similarly for both Standard MBeans and MXBeans.	__label__1

If so, the method calls the security manager's checkPermission method with the url.openConnection().getPermission() permission to ensure that the access to the image is allowed.	__label__1
Constructs a new, initially invisible window with the specified Window as its owner.	__label__0
Parameters temporal TemporalAccessor: the temporal object used to refine the result, not null Returns ValueRange the range of valid values for this field, not null	__label__1
If the field is not supported an UnsupportedTemporalTypeException must be thrown.	__label__1

Selects the list item that corresponds to the specified keyboard character and returns true, if there is an item corresponding to that character.	__label__1
"The object that will generate the parameters can be initialized in two different ways: in an algorithm-independent manner, or in an algorithm-specific manner: The algorithm-independent approach uses the fact that all parameter generators share the concept of a ""size"" and a source of randomness."	__label__1
The measure of size is universally shared by all algorithm parameters, though it is interpreted differently for different algorithms.	__label__1
"For example, in the case of parameters for the DSA algorithm, ""size"" corresponds to the size of the prime modulus (in bits)."	__label__1
When using this approach, algorithm-specific parameter generation values - if any - default to some standard values, unless they can be derived from the specified size.	__label__1
The other approach initializes a parameter generator object using algorithm-specific semantics, which are represented by a set of algorithm-specific parameter generation values.	__label__1
To generate Diffie-Hellman system parameters, for example, the parameter generation values usually consist of the size of the prime modulus and the size of the random exponent, both specified in number of bits.	__label__1
In case the client does not explicitly initialize the AlgorithmParameterGenerator (via a call to an init method), each provider must supply (and document) a default initialization.	__label__1
For example, the Sun provider uses a default modulus prime size of 1024 bits for the generation of DSA parameters.	__label__1
For a Window which is not a Frame or Dialog to be focusable, its focusable Window state must be set to true, its nearest owning Frame or Dialog must be showing on the screen, and it must contain at least one Component in its focus traversal cycle.	__label__1

If a Vector object is used, it size must be exactly equal to the number of rows in this CachedRowSet object.	__label__1
The standard reference implementation uses a Vector object to contain the column values, and it is expected that most implementations will do the same.	__label__1
Converts the designated column in this CachedRowSet object to a Collection object.	__label__0
An SQL NULL column value must be represented as a null in the Java programming language.	__label__1
Each column value should be fully represented in either a general purpose Collection implementation or a specialized Collection implementation, such as a Vector object.	__label__1
If, on the other hand, the object is of a class implementing Ref, Blob, Clob, Struct, or Array, the driver should pass it to the database as a value of the corresponding SQL type.	__label__1
If the object has a custom mapping (is of a class implementing SQLData), the driver should call the method SQLData.writeSQL to write the object to the SQL data stream.	__label__1
The default theme for the MetalLookAndFeel.	__label__0
"Therefore, developers should only use this class directly when they wish to customize the ""Ocean"" look, or force it to be the current theme, regardless of future updates."	__label__1
All colors returned by OceanTheme are completely opaque.	__label__1
Description copied from class: AbstractBorder	__label__0
However, if the method call throws an Error, then it is recommended that processing of the notification stop at that point, and if it is possible to propagate the Error to the sender of the notification, this should be done.	__label__1
If the method call of a filter or listener throws an Exception, then that exception should not prevent other listeners from being invoked.	__label__1
When such a new visit method is added, the default implementation in this class will be to call the visitUnknown method.	__label__1
Provides classes and interface relating to fonts.	__label__0
It contains support for representing Type 1, Type 1 Multiple Master fonts, OpenType fonts, and TrueType fonts.	__label__0
"For example, suppose an LDAP server supports a ""signed results"" request control, which when sent with a request, asks the server to digitally sign the results of an operation."	__label__1
Returns null if the underlying class does not have a canonical name (i.e., if it is a local or anonymous class or an array whose component type does not have a canonical name).	__label__1
Returns the canonical name of the underlying class as defined by the Java Language Specification.	__label__0
"Therefore, methods whose names begin with ""visit"" may be added to this class in the future; to avoid incompatibilities, classes which extend this class should not declare any instance methods with names beginning with ""visit""."	__label__1
Retrieves a boolean indicating whether rows marked for deletion appear in the set of current rows.	__label__0

Note: The column is specified in the table view's display order, and not in the TableModel's column order.	__label__1
Sets the value for the cell in the table model at row and column.	__label__0
Meanwhile the user's actions never affect the model's column ordering.	__label__1
This is an important distinction because as the user rearranges the columns in the table, the column at a given index in the view will change.	__label__1

WARNING: The ElementVisitor interface implemented by this class may have methods added to it in the future to accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures added to future versions of the Java™ programming language.	__label__1
An object that indicates whether a method had completed running when a SystemException was thrown.	__label__0
The class CompletionStatus contains three CompletionStatus instances, which are constants representing each possible completion status: COMPLETED_MAYBE, COMPLETED_NO, and COMPLETED_YES.	__label__1
It also contains three int members, each a constant corresponding to one of the CompletionStatus instances.	__label__0
May be thrown by a type visitor to indicate that the visitor was created for a prior version of the language.	__label__1
These int members make it possible to use a switch statement.	__label__0
This class is used in Request operations to describe the contexts that need to be resolved and sent with the invocation.	__label__0
An object containing a modifiable list of String objects that represent property names.	__label__0
This is done by calling the Context method get_values and supplying a string from a ContextList object as the third parameter.	__label__1
Provides the core classes for the Java Management Extensions.	__label__0
"A check box is a graphical component that can be in either an ""on"" (true) or ""off"" (false) state."	__label__0
Supported operations include: launching the user-default browser to show a specified URI; launching the user-default mail client with an optional mailto URI; launching a registered application to open, edit or print a specified file.	__label__0
The Desktop class allows a Java application to launch associated applications registered on the native desktop to handle a URI or a file.	__label__0
Each operation is an action type represented by the Desktop.Action class.	__label__1
If there is no associated application or the associated application fails to be launched, an exception is thrown.	__label__1
Note: when some action is invoked and the associated application is executed, it will be executed on the same system as the one on which the Java application was launched.	__label__1
Entry name prefixes are omitted when storing a keystore.	__label__1
Returns the currently set Action for this ActionEvent source, or null if no Action is set.	__label__0

It also provides a clipboard mechanism, which is an object that temporarily holds a transferable object that can be transferred between or within an application.	__label__0
Provides interfaces and classes for transferring data between and within applications.	__label__0
"It defines the notion of a ""transferable"" object, which is an object capable of being transferred between or within applications."	__label__0
When searching for first/last/next/previous Component, if a focus traversal policy provider is encountered, its focus traversal policy is used to perform the search operation.	__label__1
The clipboard is typically used for copy and paste operations.	__label__0
Although it is possible to create a clipboard to use within an application, most applications will use the system clipboard to ensure the data can be transferred across applications running on the platform.	__label__1
The paint event type.	__label__0
Returns a hashcode for the group's identifier.	__label__0
Two group identifiers that refer to the same remote group will have the same hash code.	__label__0
The driver converts this to an SQL TINYINT value when it sends it to the database.	__label__1
Sets the designated parameter to the given Java byte value.	__label__0
Otherwise, for a granted or requested permission, it must be one of the following: createMBeanServer Create a new MBeanServer object using the method MBeanServerFactory.createMBeanServer() or MBeanServerFactory.createMBeanServer(java.lang.String).	__label__1

Returns JPopupMenu that assigned for this component.	__label__0
If this component does not have a JPopupMenu assigned to it and getInheritsPopupMenu is true, this will return getParent().getComponentPopupMenu() (assuming the parent is valid.)	__label__1
It may also contain a string describing the exception.	__label__0
It contains a minor code, which gives more detailed information about what caused the exception, and a completion status.	__label__0
For example, it can be raised by an ORB if an application makes an ORB-related call without having correctly initialized the ORB first.	__label__1
This exception indicates that the caller has invoked operations in the wrong order.	__label__1
Creates a copy of this iterator.	__label__0
In such a case, an application is absolved from its responsibility to update the system selection Clipboard as described above.	__label__1
On those platforms, this method will return null.	__label__1
Typically, this is implemented by installing a FocusListener on all Components which support text selection, and, between FOCUS_GAINED and FOCUS_LOST events delivered to that Component, updating the system selection Clipboard when the selection changes inside the Component.	__label__1
An application is responsible for updating the system selection whenever the user selects text, using either the mouse or the keyboard.	__label__1
Gets the preferred size of this text field with the specified number of columns.	__label__0
Gets the singleton instance of the system selection as a Clipboard object.	__label__0
Some platforms do not support a system selection Clipboard.	__label__1
When using these classes, and their subclasses, developers need not write any additional code.	__label__1
Note that java.awt.TextComponent and javax.swing.text.JTextComponent already adhere to this policy.	__label__1
Properly updating the system selection ensures that a Java application will interact correctly with native applications and other Java applications running simultaneously on the system.	__label__1
This returns a color with rgb values 102, 102, and 102, respectively.	__label__1
Returns the secondary 1 color.	__label__1

The inputstream must contain the number of characters specified by length otherwise a SQLException will be generated when the PreparedStatement is executed.	__label__1
Sets the designated parameter to a InputStream object.	__label__0
When the setBinaryStream method is used, the driver may have to do extra work to determine whether the parameter data should be sent to the server as a LONGVARBINARY or a BLOB	__label__1
This method differs from the setBinaryStream (int, InputStream, int) method because it informs the driver that the parameter value should be sent to the server as a BLOB.	__label__1

This CachedRowSet object should lock until its contents and associated updates are fully cleared, thus preventing 'dirty' reads by other components that hold a reference to this RowSet object.	__label__1
There are no interactions with the underlying data source, and any rowset content, metadata, and content updates should be non-recoverable.	__label__1
Any outstanding updates are discarded and the rowset contains no rows after this method is called.	__label__1
Releases the current contents of this CachedRowSet object and sends a rowSetChanged event to all registered listeners.	__label__1
It is important that properties such as the command property be relevant to the originating data source from which this CachedRowSet object was originally established.	__label__1
The metadata, including JDBC properties and Synchronization SPI properties, are maintained for future use.	__label__0
This CachedRowSet object should be returned to normal behavior after firing the rowSetChanged event.	__label__1
In addition, the contents cannot be released until all all components reading this CachedRowSet object have completed their reads.	__label__1
(This is typically implemented by converting the internal address of the object into an integer, but this implementation technique is not required by the Java™ programming language.)	__label__1
Returns int a hash code value for this object.	__label__0
The byte-aligned write then starts at the next byte position.	__label__1
If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result.	__label__1
It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the equals(java.lang.Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results.	__label__1
However, the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.	__label__1
As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by class Object does return distinct integers for distinct objects.	__label__1
Returns a hash code value for the object.	__label__0
This method is supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by HashMap.	__label__1
Gets the height of the arc that rounds off the corners.	__label__0

Standard override; no change in semantics.	__label__0
Constant for the F23 function key.	__label__0
Deprecated.	__label__0
Provider implementations of this interface must overwrite the equals and hashCode methods inherited from java.lang.Object, so that secret keys are compared based on their underlying key material and not based on reference.	__label__1

The elements of the returned collection are in no particular order.	__label__1
Returns a collection containing those threads that may be waiting on the given condition associated with this synchronizer.	__label__0
Because the actual set of threads may change dynamically while constructing this result, the returned collection is only a best-effort estimate.	__label__1
If none of these is practical, the overriding class should describe the spliterator's documented policy of binding and structural interference, and should override the stream() and parallelStream() methods to create streams using a Supplier of the spliterator, as in: Stream<E> s = StreamSupport.stream(() -> spliterator(), spliteratorCharacteristics) .	__label__1
In order to preserve expected laziness behavior for the stream() and parallelStream()} methods, spliterators should either have the characteristic of IMMUTABLE or CONCURRENT, or be late-binding.	__label__1
Returns Spliterator<K> a Spliterator over the elements in this collection	__label__1
These requirements ensure that streams produced by the stream() and parallelStream() methods will reflect the contents of the collection as of initiation of the terminal stream operation.	__label__1
Implementations should document characteristic values reported by the spliterator.	__label__1
Creates a Spliterator over the elements in this collection.	__label__0
Sets the element at position i to the given value.	__label__1
Such characteristic values are not required to be reported if the spliterator reports SIZED and this collection contains no elements.	__label__1
Returns the next layout, and updates the current position.	__label__0
If the method call of a filter or listener throws an Exception, then that exception should not prevent other listeners from being invoked.	__label__1
However, if the method call throws an Error, then it is recommended that processing of the notification stop at that point, and if it is possible to propagate the Error to the sender of the notification, this should be done.	__label__1
Reads characters into an array.	__label__0
Notification dispatch When an MBean emits a notification, it considers each listener that has been added with addNotificationListener and not subsequently removed with removeNotificationListener.	__label__1
If a filter was provided with that listener, and if the filter's isNotificationEnabled method returns false, the listener is ignored.	__label__1

Note that adding a default implementation of a new visit method in a visitor class will occur instead of adding a default method directly in the visitor interface since a Java SE 8 language feature cannot be used to this version of the API since this version is required to be runnable on Java SE 7 implementations.	__label__1
For example, where appropriate, they may contain a NamedValue object to hold the return value or exception, a context, a list of possible exceptions, and a list of context strings that need to be resolved.	__label__1
When such a new visit method is added, the default implementation in this class will be to call the visitUnknown method.	__label__1

Sets the background color of this window.	__label__0
If the windowing system supports the PERPIXEL_TRANSLUCENT translucency, the alpha component of the given background color may effect the mode of operation for this window: it indicates whether this window must be opaque (alpha equals 1.0f) or per-pixel translucent (alpha is less than 1.0f).	__label__1
When the window is per-pixel translucent, the drawing sub-system respects the alpha value of each individual pixel.	__label__1
The class ExceptionList has a method for getting the number of TypeCode objects in the list, and after items have been added, it is possible to call methods for accessing or deleting an item at a designated index.	__label__1

For a proxy created with JMX.newMBeanProxy or JMX.newMXBeanProxy, this means that the method must appear in the Standard MBean or MXBean interface.	__label__1
Otherwise these methods have the following behavior: toString() returns a string representation of the proxy hashCode() returns a hash code for the proxy such that two equal proxies have the same hash code equals(Object) returns true if and only if the Object argument is of the same proxy class as this proxy, with an MBeanServerInvocationHandler that has the same MBeanServerConnection and ObjectName; if one of the MBeanServerInvocationHandlers was constructed with a Class argument then the other must have been constructed with the same Class for equals to return true.	__label__1
For example, with the method public List<String> reverse(List<String> list); and given that the mapped type for List<String> is String[], a call to proxy.reverse(someList) will convert someList from a List<String> to a String[], call the MBean operation reverse, then convert the returned String[] into a List<String>.	__label__1
The method Object.toString(), Object.hashCode(), or Object.equals(Object), when invoked on a proxy using this invocation handler, is forwarded to the MBean server as a method on the proxied MBean only if it appears in one of the proxy's interfaces.	__label__1
If the InvocationHandler is for an MXBean, then the parameters of a method are converted from the type declared in the MXBean interface into the corresponding mapped type, and the return value is converted from the mapped type into the declared type.	__label__1

An invocation of this method is equivalent to (but may be more efficient than): getFirstQueuedThread() != Thread.currentThread() && hasQueuedThreads() Note that because cancellations due to interrupts and timeouts may occur at any time, a true return does not guarantee that some other thread will acquire before the current thread.	__label__1
Queries whether any threads have been waiting to acquire longer than the current thread.	__label__0
Likewise, it is possible for another thread to win a race to enqueue after this method has returned false, due to the queue being empty.	__label__1

An appropriate implementation of a ModelMBean must be shipped with every JMX Agent and the class must be named RequiredModelMBean.	__label__1
If all of the values in the data source are already the values to be persisted, the method acceptChanges does nothing.	__label__1
After all conflicts have been resolved, an application must call the acceptChanges method again to write resolved values to the data source.	__label__1
In such cases, it is guaranteed that the writer will succeed in writing changes to the data source when the method acceptChanges is called.	__label__1
Some provider implementations may use locks to ensure that there are no conflicts.	__label__1
Note: The acceptChanges() method will determine if the COMMIT_ON_ACCEPT_CHANGES is set to true or not.	__label__1
This method may be called immediately after the methods updateRow, insertRow, or deleteRow have been called, but it is more efficient to call it only once after all changes have been made so that only one connection needs to be established.	__label__1
Otherwise, the application must explicity call the commit or rollback methods as appropriate.	__label__1
If it is set to true, all updates in the synchronization are committed to the data source.	__label__1

When such a new visit method is added, the default implementation in this class will be to call the visitUnknown method.	__label__1
Constructor for concrete subclasses; uses null for the default value.	__label__0
A simple visitor for annotation values with default behavior appropriate for the RELEASE_7 source version.	__label__0
To preserve correct behavior, these behavioral parameters must be non-interfering, and in most cases must be stateless.	__label__1
Most stream operations accept parameters that describe user-specified behavior, which are often lambda expressions.	__label__1
When the terminal operation is initiated, the stream pipeline is executed sequentially or in parallel depending on the orientation of the stream on which it is invoked.	__label__1
Except for operations identified as explicitly nondeterministic, such as findAny(), whether a stream executes sequentially or in parallel should not change the result of the computation.	__label__1
When the terminal operation is initiated, the stream pipeline is executed sequentially or in parallel depending on the mode of the stream on which it is invoked.	__label__1
The methods parameter and param_count, which are deprecated, are not mapped.	__label__1

Interceptors are intended to be a means by which ORB services gain access to ORB processing, effectively becoming part of the ORB.	__label__0
Interceptors cannot be registered on an ORB after it has been returned by a call to ORB.init.	__label__1
An Interceptor is registered by registering an associated ORBInitializer object which implements the ORBInitializer interface.	__label__1
Registering ORB Initializers in Java ORBInitializers are registered via Java ORB properties.	__label__1
A listener interface for receiving mouse motion events during a drag operation.	__label__0
Whenever the mouse moves during a drag operation initiated with this DragSource, that object's dragMouseMoved method is invoked, and the DragSourceDragEvent is passed to it.	__label__1
Create a listener object using that class and then register it with a DragSource.	__label__1
Returns the L&F object that renders this component.	__label__0
Invoked after the tree instance variable has been set, but before any defaults/listeners have been installed.	__label__1

Its functionality has been replaced by java.security.KeyStore, the java.security.cert package, and java.security.Principal.	__label__1
Sets the SyncProvider object for this CachedRowSet object to the one specified.	__label__0
This method allows the SyncProvider object to be reset.	__label__0
A CachedRowSet implementation should always be instantiated with an available SyncProvider mechanism, but there are cases where resetting the SyncProvider object is desirable or necessary.	__label__1
For example, an application might want to use the default SyncProvider object for a time and then choose to use a provider that has more recently become available and better fits its needs.	__label__1
Resetting the SyncProvider object causes the RowSet object to request a new SyncProvider implementation from the SyncFactory.	__label__1
This has the effect of resetting all previous connections and relationships with the originating data source and can potentially drastically change the synchronization behavior of a disconnected rowset.	__label__1
Atomically decrements by one the current value of the field of the given object managed by this updater.	__label__1
This method is intended to be used only for debugging purposes, and the content and format of the returned string may vary between implementations.	__label__1

Each key references a Vector object that corresponds to one row of a RowSet object.	__label__1
The TreeMap type of collection guarantees that the map will be in ascending key order, sorted according to the natural order for the key's class.	__label__1
The standard reference implementation for the CachedRowSet interface uses a TreeMap object for the rowset, with the values in each row being contained in Vector objects.	__label__1
An SQL NULL column value must be represented as a null in the Java programming language.	__label__1
Each row must be fully represented in either a general purpose Collection implementation or a specialized Collection implementation, such as a TreeMap object or a Vector object.	__label__1
Implementations have some latitude in how they can represent this Collection object because of the abstract nature of the Collection framework.	__label__0
Converts this CachedRowSet object to a Collection object that contains all of this CachedRowSet object's data.	__label__0
The key used by the TreeMap collection is determined by the implementation, which may choose to leverage a set key that is available within the internal RowSet tabular structure by virtue of a key already set either on the RowSet object itself or on the underlying SQL data.	__label__1
Therefore, the size of each Vector object must be exactly equal to the number of columns in the RowSet object.	__label__1

Sets the echo character for this text field.	__label__0
An echo character is useful for text fields where user input should not be echoed to the screen, as in the case of a text field for entering a password.	__label__1
Setting echoChar = 0 allows user input to be echoed to the screen again.	__label__1
A Java platform implementation may support only a limited, non-empty set of echo characters.	__label__1
Attempts to set an unsupported echo character will cause the default echo character to be used instead.	__label__1
Subsequent calls to getEchoChar() will return the echo character originally requested.	__label__1
This might or might not be identical to the echo character actually used by the TextField implementation.	__label__1
Invoked when the Window is set to be the focused Window, which means that the Window, or one of its subcomponents, will receive keyboard events.	__label__0

On some platforms, the weak version may be more efficient than compareAndSet in the normal case, but differs in that any given invocation of the weakCompareAndSet method may return false spuriously (that is, for no apparent reason).	__label__1
For example, a rowset may need to get a handle on the the rowset reader (RowSetReader object) from the SyncProvider to allow the rowset to be populated.	__label__1
"RowSetReader rowsetReader = null; SyncProvider provider = SyncFactory.getInstance(""javax.sql.rowset.provider.RIOptimisticProvider""); if (provider instanceof RIOptimisticProvider) { rowsetReader = provider.getRowSetReader(); } ."	__label__0
Retrieves the SyncProvider implementation for this CachedRowSet object.	__label__0
Internally, this method is used by a rowset to trigger read or write actions between the rowset and the data source.	__label__1
In addition, an application can use the SyncProvider object returned by this method to call methods that return information about the SyncProvider object, including information about the vendor, version, provider identification, synchronization grade, and locks it currently has set.	__label__1
Assuming rowsetReader is a private, accessible field within the rowset implementation, when an application calls the execute method, it in turn calls on the reader's readData method to populate the RowSet object.	__label__1
rowsetReader.readData((RowSetInternal)this); .	__label__0

Implementation Considerations The current thread is assumed to hold the lock associated with this Condition when this method is called.	__label__1
If the current thread's interrupted status is set when it enters this method, or it is interrupted while waiting, it will continue to wait until signalled.	__label__1
When it finally returns from this method its interrupted status will still be set.	__label__1
In all cases, before this method can return the current thread must re-acquire the lock associated with this condition.	__label__1
When the thread returns it is guaranteed to hold this lock.	__label__1
Causes the current thread to wait until it is signalled.	__label__0
For example, an ORB may reach the maximum number of references it can hold simultaneously in an address space, the size of a parameter may have exceeded the allowed maximum, or an ORB may impose a maximum on the number of clients or servers that can run simultaneously.	__label__1

Task<Integer> task = new Task<Integer>() { @Override protected Integer call() throws Exception { int iterations = 0; for (iterations = 0; iterations < 100000; iterations++) { if (isCancelled()) { break; } System.out.println("Iteration " + iterations); } return iterations; } @Override protected void succeeded() { super.succeeded(); updateMessage("Done!"); }	__label__0
Custom preloader implementations should follow these rules: there should be class extending Preloader classes needed for preloader need to be packaged in the separate jar.	__label__0
The current implementation limits the size of the cache (512 pixels in each dimension, and 4 MB in total) so that it doesn't grow without bound.	__label__0
These properties are set by the actual implementation of the Worker interface, but can be observed by anybody.	__label__0
Then, within the implementation of the call method, we iterate from 0 to 100000.	__label__0
node.gapProperty.isBound(); } {@literal @}Override public StyleableProperty{@literal } getStyleableProperty(MyWidget node) { return (StyleableProperty{@literal })node.gapProperty; } }; private static final List{@literal }{@literal >} cssMetaDataList; static { List{@literal }{@literal >} temp = new ArrayList{@literal }{@literal >}(Control.getClassCssMetaData()); temp.add(GAP_META_DATA); cssMetaDataList = Collections.unmodifiableList(temp); } public static List{@literal }{@literal >} getClassCssMetaData() { return cssMetaDataList; } {@literal @}Override public List{@literal }{@literal >} getCssMetaData() { return getClassCssMetaData(); }	__label__0
They can be constant values or implementations of javafx.beans.value.ObservableValue.	__label__0
An implementation of Observable may support lazy evaluation, which means that the content is not immediately recomputed after changes, but lazily the next time it is requested.	__label__0
Such as ScheduledService might be implemented like this:  ScheduledService<Document> svc = new ScheduledService<Document>() { protected Task<Document> createTask() { return new Task<Document>() { protected Document call() { // Connect to a Server // Get the XML document // Parse it into a document return document; } }; } }; svc.setPeriod(Duration.seconds(1));  This example will ping the remote server every 1 second.	__label__0
An implementation of ObservableValue may support lazy evaluation, which means that the value is not immediately recomputed after changes, but lazily the next time the value is requested.	__label__0
final Group group = new Group(); Task<Void> task = new Task<Void>() { @Override protected Void call() throws Exception { for (int i=0; i<100; i++) { if (isCancelled()) break; final Rectangle r = new Rectangle(10, 10); r.setX(10 * i); Platform.runLater(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { group.getChildren().add(r); } }); } return null; } };  Reacting To State Changes Generically Sometimes you may want to write a Task which updates its progress, message, text, or in some other way reacts whenever a state change happens on the Task.	__label__0
Task<Long> task = new Task<Long>() { @Override protected Long call() throws Exception { long a=0; long b=1; for (long i = 0; i < Long.MAX_VALUE; i++){ updateValue(a); a += b; b = a - b; } return a; } };  Another way to do this is to expose a new property on the Task which will represent the partial result.	__label__0
The following example shows how the Change build-up works:  public void removeOddIndexes() { beginChange(); try { for (int i = 1; i < size(); ++i) { remove(i); } } finally { endChange(); } } public void remove(int i) { beginChange(); try { E removed = ... //do some stuff that will actually remove the element at index i nextRemove(i, removed); } finally { endChange(); } }  The try/finally blocks in the example are needed only if there's a possibility for an exception to occur inside a beginChange() / endChange() block Note: If you want to create modifiable ObservableList implementation, consider using ModifiableObservableListBase as a superclass.	__label__0
Applications may choose to implement their own Interpolator to get custom interpolation behavior.	__label__0
The method StyleableProperty#getCssMetaData() is not implemented.	__label__0
final int totalIterations = 9000000; Task<Integer> task = new Task<Integer>() { @Override protected Integer call() throws Exception { int iterations; for (iterations = 0; iterations < totalIterations; iterations++) { if (isCancelled()) { updateMessage("Cancelled"); break; } updateMessage("Iteration " + iterations); updateProgress(iterations, totalIterations); } return iterations; } };  Since totalIterations is final, the call method can safely read it and refer to it from a background thread.	__label__0
public final class MyButton extends Button { private static final{@literal StyleablePropertyFactory} FACTORY = new{@literal StyleablePropertyFactory<>}(Button.getClassCssMetaData()); MyButton(String labelText) { super(labelText); getStyleClass().add("my-button"); } // Typical JavaFX property implementation public{@literal ObservableValue} selectedProperty() { return ({@literal ObservableValue})selected; } public final boolean isSelected() { return selected.getValue(); } public final void setSelected(boolean isSelected) { selected.setValue(isSelected); } // StyleableProperty implementation reduced to one line private final{@literal StyleableProperty} selected = FACTORY.createStyleableBooleanProperty(this, "selected", "-my-selected", s{@literal ->} s.selected); {@literal @}Override public{@literal List>} getControlCssMetaData() { return FACTORY.getCssMetaData(); } }  The example above is the simplest use of StyleablePropertyFactory.	__label__0
Subclasses which also override these methods must take care to invoke the super implementation.	__label__0
By convention, node classes that have CssMetaData will implement a static method getClassCssMetaData() and it is customary to have getCssMetaData() simply return getClassCssMetaData().	__label__0
A common code pattern for doing this looks something like the following:  ObservableList theList = ...; theList.addListener(new ListChangeListener<Item>() { public void onChanged(Change<tem> c) { while (c.next()) { if (c.wasPermutated()) { for (int i = c.getFrom(); i < c.getTo(); ++i) { //permutate } } else if (c.wasUpdated()) { //update item } else { for (Item remitem : c.getRemoved()) { remitem.remove(Outer.this); } for (Item additem : c.getAddedSubList()) { additem.add(Outer.this); } } } } }); } Warning: This class directly accesses the source list to acquire information about the changes.	__label__0
Task<Integer> task = new Task<Integer>() { @Override protected Integer call() throws Exception { int iterations; for (iterations = 0; iterations < 1000; iterations++) { if (isCancelled()) { updateMessage("Cancelled"); break; } updateMessage("Iteration " + iterations); updateProgress(iterations, 1000); // Now block the thread for a short time, but be sure // to check the interrupted exception for cancellation!	__label__0
In general this interface should not be implemented directly but one of its sub-interfaces (WritableBooleanValue etc.).	__label__0
In general this interface should not be implemented directly but one of its sub-interfaces ( ObservableBooleanValue etc.).	__label__0
This example uses the factory to access the CssMetaData that was created along with the anonymous inner-class.	__label__0
The implementation ensure that the priority for setting the value is, in increasing order and assuming equal importance: a style from a user agent stylesheet in javafx.application.Application#setUserAgentStylesheet(java.lang.String) value set from code, for example calling javafx.scene.Node#setOpacity(double) a style from an author stylesheet in javafx.scene.Scene#getStylesheets() or javafx.scene.Parent#getStylesheets() a style from javafx.scene.Node#setStyle(java.lang.String) The StyleablePropertyFactory greatly simplifies creating a StyleableProperty and its corresponding CssMetaData.	__label__0
These methods greatly reduce the amount of boiler-plate code needed to implement the StyleableProperty and CssMetaData.	__label__0
This example is a typical implementation.	__label__0
In order to track changes, the internal array is encapsulated and there is no direct access available from the outside.	__label__0
public class PartialResultsTask extends Task<ObservableList<Rectangle>> { // Uses Java 7 diamond operator private ReadOnlyObjectWrapper> partialResults = new ReadOnlyObjectWrapper<>(this, "partialResults", FXCollections.observableArrayList(new ArrayList())); public final ObservableList getPartialResults() { return partialResults.get(); } public final ReadOnlyObjectProperty> partialResultsProperty() { return partialResults.getReadOnlyProperty(); } @Override protected ObservableList call() throws Exception { updateMessage("Creating Rectangles..."); for (int i=0; i<100; i++) { if (isCancelled()) break; final Rectangle r = new Rectangle(10, 10); r.setX(10 * i); Platform.runLater(new Runnable() { @Override public void run() { partialResults.get().add(r); } }); updateProgress(i, 100); } return partialResults.get(); } }  A Task Which Modifies The Scene Graph Generally, Tasks should not interact directly with the UI.	__label__0
Implementer Note: The ready(), scheduled(), running(), succeeded(), cancelled(), and failed() methods are implemented in this class.	__label__0
TaskCallable actually implements the Callable contract as defined for the FutureTask class, and is necessary so as to allow us to intercept the call() operation to update state on the Task as appropriate.	__label__0
The methods are sorted in such a way that methods which override each other will sit next to each other, with the overridden method first - e.g. Object getFoo() is placed before Integer getFoo().	__label__0
Every access control model must implement this interface in order to be integrated in the engine based framework.	__label__0
Note that this is typically the case for EJB implementations.	__label__0
Typically this is the path of strings starting from the Root POA to get to a POA, but other implementations are possible.	__label__0
You will only access instances of this class through their SnmpMibRequest interface.	__label__0
As a Swing component, it should only be accessed from the event dispatch thread, except the setScene method, which can be called either on the event dispatch thread or on the JavaFX application thread.	__label__0
A doclet supporting the language features added since 1.1 (such as generics and annotations) should indicate this by implementing languageVersion.	__label__0
A axis implementation that will works on string categories where each value as a unique category(tick mark) along the axis.	__label__0
WebView objects must be created and accessed solely from the FX thread.	__label__0

An implementation a NamingContext must extend this class and implement the NamingContextDataStore interface with the operations: Bind(), Resolve(), Unbind(), List(), NewContext() and Destroy().	__label__0
Note that the default converter is implemented simply as shown below, which may be adequate in many cases, but it is important for users to ensure that this suits their needs (and adjust when necessary).	__label__0
Class TransientBindingIterator implements the abstract methods defined by BindingIteratorImpl, to use with the TransientNamingContext implementation of the NamingContextImpl.	__label__0
This is a JavaScript object that acts as a proxy for the Java object, in that accessing properties of the JavaRuntimeObject causes the Java field or method with the same name to be accessed.	__label__0
There are a number of predefined converters which are accessible by the static methods of this class.	__label__0
Interface used to combine the Activator and Locator when both are implemented together in the same process, as is currently the case for our implementation.	__label__0
The JMX javax.management.MBeanServerFactory allows for applications to provide their custom MBeanServer implementation.	__label__0
This list is designed to be accessed as efficiently as possible during runtime, with the expense of added complexity during initialization and interceptor registration.	__label__0
Although other licensees may choose to distribute these classes, developers cannot depend on their availability in non-Sun implementations.	__label__0
This class is not used when the whole Sun Reference JMX Implementation is used.	__label__0
Some pointers: It is recommended that subclasses of Cell override the startEdit() method to update the visuals of the cell when enters the editing state.	__label__0
Implementation of ScrollBarUI for the Motif Look and Feel Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases.	__label__0
A replacement default interceptor may build on this behavior, for instance by adding logging or security checks, before forwarding requests to the initial default interceptor.	__label__0
This is an abstract class, because in its implementation none of the checking methods does anything.	__label__0
If there is no SecurityManager, then the access controller will refuse to create an MBean that is a ClassLoader, which includes MLets, or to execute the method addURL on an MBean that is an MLet.	__label__0
The ORB implementation packages are mapped into these domains as follows: activation: orbd.*	__label__0
The readwrite access level can be qualified by one or more clauses, where each clause looks like create classNamePattern or unregister.	__label__0
This implementation is moving to comply with CORBA 3.0 due to the many clarifications that have been made to the POA semantics since CORBA 2.3.1.	__label__0
If you want to specialize the Cell used for the ListView (for example), then you must provide an implementation of the cellFactory callback function defined on the ListView.	__label__0
However it may be used to substitute Sun MBeanServer implementation to another JMX implementation.	__label__0
Duration instances are immutable, and are therefore replaced rather than modified, similar to java.math.BigDecimal.	__label__0
An interceptor, default or not, need not implement MBeans as Java objects, in the way that the initial default interceptor does.	__label__0
It uses the TransientNameService class for the name service implementation, and the BootstrapServer for implementing bootstrapping, i.e., to get the initial NamingContext.	__label__0
Access to an instance of this class is serialized by the POA mutex.	__label__0
The model may be implemented such that values may be loaded in memory as they are needed.	__label__0
This allows marshaling complex types and graphs using the ObjectOutputStream implementation.	__label__0
This is the responsibility of the Cell implementation being used.	__label__0
In this implementation the default UI is extended to act as a simple view factory.	__label__0
To override the default configuration use the com.sun.management.jmxremote.login.config management property described in the JRE/lib/management/management.properties file.	__label__0
DUP_X2 - Duplicate top operand stack word and put three down Stack: ..., word3, word2, word1 -> ..., word1, word3, word2, word1	__label__0
Interface that every SNMP model must implement in order to be integrated in the engine framework.	__label__0
The implementation of the cell factory is then responsible not just for creating a Cell instance, but also configuring that Cell such that it reacts to changes in its state.	__label__0
Changes to this map are propagated to the implementation layer.	__label__0
Class NamingContextImpl implements the org.omg.CosNaming::NamingContext interface, but does not implement the methods associated with maintaining the "table" of current bindings in a NamingContext.	__label__0
Your cell implementation will know when the editing is over, based on the user input (e.g. when the user presses the Enter or ESC keys on their keyboard).	__label__0
The native code will interpret the windowType property and automatically implement appropriate animation when the window is shown/hidden.	__label__0
An object of this class implements the MBeanServer interface and, for each of its methods, calls an appropriate checking method and then forwards the request to a wrapped MBeanServer object.	__label__0
This is because the ComboBox enforces the need for a javafx.scene.control.SingleSelectionModel instance, and it is not likely that there is much need for alternate implementations.	__label__0
It may instead implement virtual MBeans, which do not exist as Java objects when they are not in use.	__label__0
The node can implement this interface itself or use a separate object that implements it.	__label__0
This allows unmarshaling complex types and graphs using the ObjectInputStream implementation.	__label__0
The default SelectionModel used when instantiating a TableView is an implementation of the MultipleSelectionModel abstract class.	__label__0
Implementations of this interface must have a public no-args constructor.	__label__0
The supported access level values are readonly and readwrite.	__label__0
In its handler, the gesture target can access the data on the dragboard.	__label__0
The text in range is deleted and replaced by text in the Change.	__label__0
IORInfoImpl is the implementation of the IORInfo class, as described in orbos/99-12-02, section 7.	__label__0
Typically you'd write the JavaScript expression:  receiver["method_name(param_type1,...,param_typeN)"](arg1,...,argN)  Threading WebEngine objects must be created and accessed solely from the JavaFX Application thread.	__label__0
Note that the Java objects bound using JSObject.setMember, JSObject.setSlot, and JSObject.call are implemented using weak references.	__label__0
This means that the Java object can be garbage collected, causing subsequent accesses to the JavaScript objects to have no effect.	__label__0
So instead the ListView skin implementation might only create just enough cells to fit the visual space.	__label__0
Factories can be registered, and invoked through a create method, which must be implemented to handle the case of no registered factory appropriately.	__label__0
You can use this feature to obtain on contextual information (such as community string etc...) or to implement a caching mechanism, or for whatever purpose might be required by your specific agent implementation.	__label__0
An object of this class implements the MBeanServerAccessController interface and, for each of its methods, calls an appropriate checking method and then forwards the request to a wrapped MBeanServer object.	__label__0
This class implements the octree quantization method as it is described in the "Graphics Gems" (ISBN 0-12-286166-3, Chapter 4, pages 297-293)	__label__0
The only time TableRow is likely to be encountered at all by a developer is if they wish to create a custom rowFactory that replaces an entire row of a TableView.	__label__0
Creating a POA with an instance pol of this policy where pol.getType() > NO_SERVANT_CACHING will cause the servant to be looked up in the POA and cached in the LocalClientRequestDispatcher when the ClientRequestDispatcher is colocated with the implementation of the objref.	__label__0
Using this method, you will not replace the default implementation, but you will be notified when an edit commit has occurred.	__label__0
Instead, this implementation assumes that the derived implementation implements the NamingContextDataStore interface, which has the necessary methods.	__label__0
A versatile Icon implementation which can take an array of Icon instances (typically ImageIcons) and choose one that gives the best quality for a given Graphics2D scale factor when painting.	__label__0
Some text was replaced: The combination of the 2 cases above.	__label__0
One object implementing this interface will be created for every MIB involved in a SNMP request, and that object will be passed to the SnmpMibAgent in charge of handling that MIB.	__label__0
In this case it will call the cellFactory callback function (if one is provided) to create the Cell implementation that should be used.	__label__0
A ComboBox typically has a button that, when clicked, will pop up some means of allowing a user to select one or more values (depending on the implementation).	__label__0
Class InteroperableNamingImpl implements the methods defined for NamingContextExt which is part of Interoperable Naming Service specifications.	__label__0
It may be used as a base class, in which case the guards and actions have access to the derived class.	__label__0
This file was automatically generated by AutoMulti.	__label__0
The only time TreeTableRow is likely to be encountered at all by a developer is if they wish to create a custom rowFactory that replaces an entire row of a TreeTableView.	__label__0
It will eventually become extensible, but for now it simply encapsulates the existing implementation.	__label__0
Instead of creating IndexedCell directly, you should instead make use of the control-specific cell implementations (for example, ListCell, TreeCell) TableRow and TableCell).	__label__0
This class implements a very simply IOR representation which must be completely ORBImpl free so that this class can be used in the implementation of a portable StubDelegateImpl.	__label__0
A portion of a registry dealing with a single superclass or interface.	__label__0
Class BootstrapServer is the main entry point for the bootstrap server implementation.	__label__0
Class BindingIteratorImpl implements the org.omg.CosNaming::BindingIterator interface, but does not implement the method to retrieve the next binding in the NamingContext for which it was created.	__label__0
The operation next_one() is implemented by the subclass, whereas next_n() is implemented on top of the next_one() implementation.	__label__0
The ImageInputStreamImpl class defines a finalize() method, but in a number of its public subclasses (e.g. FileImageInputStream) we override the finalize() method to be empty for performance reasons, and instead rely on the Disposer mechanism for closing/disposing resources.	__label__0
Note that this is a direct Java implementation of the abstract value type: there is no stateful value type defined in IDL, since defining the state in IDL is awkward and inefficient.	__label__0
IMPORTANT: PICurrent is implemented with the assumption that get_slot() or set_slot() will not be called in ORBInitializer.pre_init() and post_init().	__label__0
You will not need to implement this interface except if your agent needs extra customization requiring some contextual information.	__label__0
These methods include the following: createButton(ButtonType) createDetailsButton() createButtonBar() These methods are documented, so please take note of the expectations placed on any developer who wishes to override these methods with their own functionality.	__label__0
The choice of implementation will not however have any effect on player behavior at the interface level.	__label__0
It implements the getIOPComponent method using the TaggedComponent.write() method.	__label__0
This factory, implementing mandatorily SnmpEngineFactory is set in the method setFactory.	__label__0
It implements Server so that it can be registered as a subcontract.	__label__0
E.g. when some text is being deleted, you can simply replace it by some placeholder text just by setting a new text (setText("new text")) The Change is mutable, but not observable.	__label__0
Objects implementing this interface will be allocated by the SNMP engine.	__label__0
This is delegates to the real implementation.	__label__0
You will never need to implement this interface.	__label__0
When the presentation block asks for data the implementation of InputObject is responsible for converting the encoded representation of the data to the types expected by the programming language.	__label__0
Note that this facility eventually shows up post-CORBA 3.0 as a result of the resolution of OMG core issue on accessing the ORB from local objects.	__label__0
Every time setContent is called, any previous data on the clipboard is cleared and replaced with this new content.	__label__0
A replacement exporter can be specified via the EXPORTER_ATTRIBUTE property in the environment Map passed to the RMI connector server.	__label__0
Thus, any given username either does not exist in the properties or has exactly one access level.	__label__0
Access to the Dragboard is provided by the getDragboard() method.	__label__0
Conversely, most other controls (ListView, TreeView, TableView, etc) require MultipleSelectionModel implementations (although MultipleSelectionModel does still allow for single selection to be set via the selectionMode property).	__label__0
A DOM Node is mapped to an object that both extends JSObject and implements the appropriate DOM interfaces.	__label__0
Note that the actual implementation may support more than one IOR in the case of GIOP with Location Forward messages.	__label__0
The following two methods are equivalent (and the second call will override the first!)	__label__0
Server implementation objects may either inherit from javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject or they may implement a remote interface and then use the exportObject method to register themselves as a server object.	__label__0
Note that support for transition effects may be supported with a different mechanism in the future and so this class is package-private and targeted for Swing implementation use only.	__label__0
However, it is not necessary to implement a Skin for most uses of a Cell.	__label__0
It allows for different implementations of naming contexts that support the same API but differ in storage mechanism.	__label__0

This class wraps the actual ClassLoaderRepository implementation so that only the methods from javax.management.loading.ClassLoaderRepository can be accessed (read-only).	__label__0
Do not call or override.	__label__0
The FSM only needs the identity of this object, so all that is really needs is the default equals implementation.	__label__0
Otherwise, it would not be obvious that granting write access grants the ability to download and execute arbitrary code in the target MBean server.	__label__0
A more complete implementation may need to handle more // dynamic file system situations (such as where a folder has files // added after the TreeView is shown).	__label__0
Some effects change the color properties of the source pixels (such as ColorAdjust), others combine multiple images together (such as Blend), while still others warp or move the pixels of the source image around (such as DisplacementMap or PerspectiveTransform).	__label__0
The sequence allocateUserData() / releaseUserData() can also be used to implement a caching mechanism: allocateUserData() could be used to allocate some cache space, and releaseUserData() could be used to flush it.	__label__0
Users of the ORB may create implementations of this class and also corresponding factories of type TaggedComponentFactory.	__label__0
In both cases, the name of each property represents a username, and the value of the property is the associated access level.	__label__0
and implement the start(RootDoc) method, as described in the package description.	__label__0
For example:  Rectangle2D primaryScreenBounds = Screen.getPrimary().getVisualBounds(); //set Stage boundaries to visible bounds of the main screen stage.setX(primaryScreenBounds.getMinX()); stage.setY(primaryScreenBounds.getMinY()); stage.setWidth(primaryScreenBounds.getWidth()); stage.setHeight(primaryScreenBounds.getHeight()); stage.show();  	__label__0

Indicates there is no object reference for the given name.	__label__0
thrown, with a standard minor code of 2, if a policy for the given type was not registered via register_policy_factory.	__label__0
The specified class loader is not registered in the MBean server.	__label__0
An application may use the setSocketFactory method to request that the RMI runtime use its socket factory instance instead of the default implementation.	__label__0
The HTTP tunneling mechanisms described above, specifically HTTP with an explicit port and HTTP to a cgi-bin script, are deprecated.	__label__0
An attempt has been made to cast an object to a subclass of which it is not an instance.	__label__0
There is no indication of the portion of the Raster that may or may not be good.	__label__0
Note that the classes in the com.sun.image.codec.jpeg package are not part of the core Java APIs.	__label__0
Although other licensees may choose to distribute these classes, developers cannot depend on their availability in non-Sun implementations.	__label__0
We expect that equivalent functionality will eventually be available in a core API or standard extension.	__label__0
The MBean named by listener exists but does not implement the NotificationListener interface.	__label__0
Any values can be dynamically interpreted (traversed) and constructed through DynAny objects.	__label__0
There is a different interface, inheriting from the DynAny interface, associated with each kind of constructed type in IDL (fixed, enum, struct, sequence, union, array, exception, and value type).	__label__0
This means that the DynStruct may be seen as owning an ordered collection of components, one for each structure member.	__label__0
Calling an insert or get operation leaves the current position unchanged.	__label__0
a Java exception.	__label__0
The behavior of DynAny objects has been defined in order to enable efficient implementations in terms of allocated memory space and speed of access.	__label__0
Their use for other purposes is not recommended.	__label__0
Insert and get operations are necessary to handle basic DynAny objects but are also helpful to handle constructed DynAny objects.	__label__0
For example, invoking insert_boolean on a DynStruct implies inserting a boolean data value at the current position of the associated struct data value.	__label__0
MetalTreeUI allows for configuring how to visually render the spacing and delineation between nodes.	__label__0
This class is not a JMX compliant MBean	__label__0
As it is typically impractical to obtain the TreeUI from the JTree and cast to an instance of MetalTreeUI you enable this property via the client property JTree.lineStyle.	__label__0
The contents of the structure are volatile and the contents of the character buffer cannot be assured once the method that is passed this structure returns.	__label__0
This is the main class that represents an instance of a state machine using a state engine.	__label__0
An Adler-32 checksum is almost as reliable as a CRC-32 but can be computed much faster.	__label__0
Icon factory for the CDE/Motif Look and Feel Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases.	__label__0
An instance of an InetAddress consists of an IP address and possibly its corresponding host name (depending on whether it is constructed with a host name or whether it has already done reverse host name resolution).	__label__0
Wraps exceptions from the persistence mechanism	__label__0
The Unspecified Address -- Also called anylocal or wildcard address.	__label__0
multicast An identifier for a set of interfaces (typically belonging to different nodes).	__label__0
The result of unsuccessful host name resolution is cached for a very short period of time (10 seconds) to improve performance.	__label__0
Likewise, a system admin can configure a different negative caching TTL value when needed.	__label__0
See ObjectFactory.getObjectInstance().	__label__0
Two Java security properties control the TTL values used for positive and negative host name resolution caching:  networkaddress.cache.ttl Indicates the caching policy for successful name lookups from the name service.	__label__0
Serialization proxy, used to avoid reference to the non-public Striped64 superclass in serialized forms.	__label__0
The specified class is not a JMX compliant MBean	__label__0
An object is already bound under the supplied name.	__label__0
This subclass of ObjectInputStream delegates loading of classes to an existing MLetClassLoader.	__label__0
The specified class loader is not registered in the MBaenServer.	__label__0
 I'm interpreting this as: It is the parser's responsibilty to call the non-DOM operation setReadOnly(true,true) after it constructs the Entity.	__label__0
Since the DOM explicitly decided not to deal with this, _any_ answer will involve a non-DOM operation, and this is the simplest solution.	__label__0
Signals that a method has been invoked at an illegal or inappropriate time.	__label__0
A utility class that wraps the ThreadController, which is used by IncrementalSAXSource for the incremental building of DTM.	__label__0
A ComboBox typically has a button that, when clicked, will pop up some means of allowing a user to select one or more values (depending on the implementation).	__label__0
This attribute is particularly useful when a single service supports multiple devices (so called "fan-out").	__label__0
may be thrown by handler's characters() method.	__label__0
Any XNI exception, possibly wrapping another exception.	__label__0
Thrown by application to signal an error.	__label__0
An SslRMIServerSocketFactory instance is used by the RMI runtime in order to obtain server sockets for RMI calls via SSL.	__label__0
Handles invocation of interceptors.	__label__0
Has specific knowledge of how to invoke IOR, ClientRequest, and ServerRequest interceptors.	__label__0
Makes use of the InterceptorList to retrieve the list of interceptors to be invoked.	__label__0
Most methods in this class are package scope so that they may only be called from the PIHandlerImpl.	__label__0
However JTable employs a unique mechanism for rendering its cells and therefore requires some slightly modified behavior from its cell renderer.	__label__0
Thrown in the event of an internal error.	__label__0
The specified class loader is not registered in the MBeanServer.	__label__0
This would greatly decrease performance because the revalidate message would be passed up the hierarchy of the container to determine whether any other components would be affected.	__label__0
As the renderer is only parented for the lifetime of a painting operation we similarly want to avoid the overhead associated with walking the hierarchy for painting operations.	__label__0
If you write your own renderer, please keep this performance consideration in mind.	__label__0
An instance of this class is maintained per AppContext, and the public static methods call into the appropriate instance.	__label__0
Thrown by handler to signal an error.	__label__0
FCONST - Push 0.0, 1.0 or 2.0, other values cause an exception Stack: ... -> ...,	__label__0
To create a simple, ungrouped RadioMenuItem, do the following:  RadioMenuItem radioItem = new RadioMenuItem("radio text"); radioItem.setSelected(false); radioItem.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() { @Override public void handle(ActionEvent e) { System.out.println("radio toggled"); } });  The problem with the example above is that this offers no benefit over using a normal MenuItem.	__label__0
As already mentioned, the purpose of a RadioMenuItem is to offer multiple choices to the user, and only allow for one of these choices to be selected at any one time (i.e. the selection should be mutually exclusive).	__label__0
because this is a locally constrained object and this method does not apply to local objects	__label__0
Subclasses which wish to listen to combo box property changes should call the superclass methods to ensure that the combo popup correctly handles property changes.	__label__0
to indicate to the ORB that it is responsible for delivering the current request and subsequent requests to the object denoted in the forward_reference member of the exception.	__label__0
An ActivationID is also obtained during the Activatable.register call.	__label__0
for an invalid axis type	__label__0
The symbol table performs the same task as String.intern() with the following differences: A new string object does not need to be created in order to retrieve a unique reference.	__label__0
For example, a simple string hashing algorithm may fail to produce a balanced set of hashcodes for symbols that are mostly unique.	__label__0
The exception description.	__label__0
if there is a SecurityManager and the caller's permissions do not include or imply MBeanPermission("getClassLoaderRepository").	__label__0
Indicates an object is already bound to the specified name.	__label__0
If thrown, indicates to the ORB that a retry of the request should occur with the new object given in the exception.	__label__0
Any of the usual Input/Output related exceptions.	__label__0
Thrown if this factory cannot create a Codec of the given encoding.	__label__0
thrown if the file cannot be opened for output.	__label__0
All document instructions having to do with color are embedded within the print data (none are attributes attached to the job outside the print data).	__label__0
Examples would include trying to insert something other than an Attr node into an Element's map of attributes, or a non-Entity node into the DocumentType's map of Entities.	__label__0
ColorSupported is a printer description attribute that tells whether the printer can print in color regardless of how the client specifies to print any particular document.	__label__0
Provides portable interceptor functionality.	__label__0
Permission Target Name What the Permission Allows Risks of Allowing this Permission suppressAccessChecks ability to suppress the standard Java language access checks on fields and methods in a class; allow access not only public members but also allow access to default (package) access, protected, and private members.	__label__0
See Class#newInstance() for details.	__label__0
Malicious code may use these classes to help in its attempt to compromise security in the system.	__label__0

It can be consulted by a subclass of <noun>MLet</noun> that overrides the <noun>MLet.check</noun> method.	__label__0
Once they diverge this code will need to be replaced.	__label__0
In most cases, the Runnable interface should be used if you are only planning to override the run() method and no other Thread methods.	__label__0
This means that parsed entities declared in the external subset need not be expanded by some classes of applications, and that the replacement text of the entity may not be available.	__label__0
They are not needed since modern three-letter language codes replace them.	__label__0
The delegate is a singleton instance of a class that implements this interface and provides a replacement implementation for all the methods of javax.rmi.CORBA.Util.	__label__0

DefaultListCellRenderer doesn't implement UIResource directly so that applications can safely override the cellRenderer property with DefaultListCellRenderer subclasses.	__label__0
A write lock is acquired by the methods that mutate the document, and are held for the duration of the method call.	__label__0
In an element representing a nullary method whose name starts with "get", the "method" attribute is replaced with a "property" attribute whose value is given by removing the "get" prefix and decapitalizing the result.	__label__0
Client code can use this fact to write replacement functions for invokeLater and invokeAndWait without writing special-case code in any AWTEventListener objects.	__label__0
Usage Notes: Use EmptyBorder to create a plain border (this mechanism replaces its predecessor, setInsets).	__label__0
The methods are sorted in such a way that methods which override each other will sit next to each other, with the overridden method first - e.g. Object getFoo() is placed before Integer getFoo().	__label__0
Notification is done on the thread that produced the mutation, and the thread has full read access to the document for the duration of the notification, but other readers are kept out until the notification has finished.	__label__0
In the case of writing, destination regions may be used only with a writer that supports pixel replacement.	__label__0
So this class overrides the validate, invalidate, revalidate, repaint, and firePropertyChange methods to be no-ops and override the isOpaque method solely to improve performance.	__label__0
Subclasses are free to override the implementation and specification of any of the methods in this class as long as the general <noun>Processor</noun> contract for that method is obeyed.	__label__0
Therefore, the following target names have also been deprecated:  getPolicy - allow the caller to retrieve the system-wide Subject-based access control policy.	__label__0
Every time setContent is called, any previous data on the clipboard is cleared and replaced with this new content.	__label__0

Any models subclassed from this class and used in conjunction with a text component that has a look and feel implementation that is derived from BasicTextUI may be safely updated asynchronously, because all access to the View hierarchy is serialized by BasicTextUI if the document is of type AbstractDocument.	__label__0
The ImageInputStreamImpl class defines a finalize() method, but in a number of its public subclasses (e.g. FileImageInputStream) we override the finalize() method to be empty for performance reasons, and instead rely on the Disposer mechanism for closing/disposing resources.	__label__0
important" rules take precedence over both override and author "!	__label__0
public boolean isMagic() { return magic.get(); } public BooleanProperty magicProperty() { return magic; } public BooleanProperty magic = new BooleanPropertyBase(false) { {@literal @}Override protected void invalidated() { pseudoClassStateChanged(MAGIC_PSEUDO_CLASS.	__label__0
Note that even when the root element's element name is mapped by <noun>JAXBContext</noun>, the declaredType parameter overrides that mapping for deserializing the root element when using these unmarshal methods.	__label__0
The <noun>getRemoved()</noun> method returns a list of elements that have been replaced or removed from the list.	__label__0
Similarly, keySet() can be overriden to return NavigableSet.	__label__0
This style sheet comes after the author style sheet in the cascade algorithm and is called override style sheet.	__label__0
Hence, some applications may not make the replacement value available for Parsed Entities of these types.	__label__0
E.g. when some text is being deleted, you can simply replace it by some placeholder text just by setting a new text (<noun>setText("new text")</noun>) The Change is mutable, but not observable.	__label__0
The only time TreeTableRow is likely to be encountered at all by a developer is if they wish to create a custom <noun>rowFactory</noun> that replaces an entire row of a TreeTableView.	__label__0
All CompletionStage methods are implemented independently of other public methods, so the behavior of one method is not impacted by overrides of others in subclasses.	__label__0
The class FilterInputStream itself simply overrides all methods of InputStream with versions that pass all requests to the contained input stream.	__label__0
Extend this class to create a <noun>MouseEvent</noun> (including drag and motion events) or/and <noun>MouseWheelEvent</noun> listener and override the methods for the events of interest. (	__label__0
se.getBody().detachNode();  To create a SOAPHeader object to replace the one that was removed, a client uses the method SOAPEnvelope.addHeader, which creates a new header and adds it to the SOAPEnvelope object.	__label__0
This can happen when ComponentColorModel is subclassed to override the mapping of unsigned sample values to normalized color component values or when signed sample values outside a certain range are used. (	__label__0
The locking assumes that an independent thread will access the View hierarchy only from the DocumentListener methods, and that there will be only one event thread active at a time.	__label__0
